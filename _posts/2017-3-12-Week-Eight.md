### What did you do this past week?
This week we discussed Project 3: Allocator. My partner and I also started the project.

### What's in your way?
Since this upcoming week is Spring Break, I do not have many challenges in my way. However, I do need to balance relaxing and having fun with getting work done and being productive.

### What will you do next week?
As I mentioned above, next week is Spring Break and I do not have much planned. Project 3 is due the following week. So for this class, I will be working on Project 3 with my partner (and some remotely).

### What's my experience of the class?
Monday and Wednesday of this past week were typical class days. I had mixed results on the quizzes (I did well on one but not the other) so I need to keep working on preparing for those quizzes. We did not have class on Friday, which I thought was a nice gesture, but unfortunately I still had class later that day so my Spring Break did not start earlier.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week (for anyone in Austin over Spring Break) is to attend technology related events at South by Southwest (SXSW). A lot of companies show up at SXSW to showcase new technology and to host things like workshops. The best part is that there are tons of great events that you donâ€™t need a SXSW badge for. Unfortunately I am not in Austin for the break but my roommate is. So far he has already gone to an all-day workshop with the CTO of Amazon. He also plans to attend a hackathon later in the week. If you need a break from the technology, SXSW is also a music and film festival, with free events sprinkled throughout the week.
