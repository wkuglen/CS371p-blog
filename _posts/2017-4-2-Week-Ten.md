### What did you do this past week?
During Monday’s class, we talked about Project 4: Darwin. Atlassian gave a talk on Monday evening, which Professor Downing gave the class extra credit for attending. During class on Wednesday and Friday, we started to recreate C++’s vector class. We started off implementing vector in a naive way using new and delete and then we later implemented it using an allocator.

### What's in your way?
For this class, Project 4: Darwin is in my way. My partner and I started late (this weekend) so we don’t have a concrete plan for solving Project 4 yet.

### What will you do next week?
Next week Project 4: Darwin is due on Thursday. Since my partner and I just started we still need to finish it this week.

### What's my experience of the class?
For my experience of the class this week, I figured I would write about the Atlassian presentation (as Professor Downing requested). Besides earning extra credit, I really enjoyed the talk by some software engineers at Atlassian. The presentation was split into two parts: the company itself and a problem that the presenters had to solve on the job. I was glad that they had talked about both because while I had heard of the company before, I didn’t know what it was like. Their explanation of their problem and their solution also helped me envision what it would be like to work at Atlassian. The speakers also looked like they enjoyed working at Atlassian and were happy to share their experiences with us. During the question and answer portion someone asked about working in Austin compared to Silicon Valley. The presenters all seemed to agree that while Silicon Valley has a lot going on, especially for start-ups, Austin has better benefits, especially financially. Overall, I really enjoyed the talk and I hope I can attend another one this semester.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this video about the UNIX Operating System](https://youtu.be/tc4ROCJYbm0) that was made by Bell Labs (AT&T) in 1982, which I found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/622kkn/the_unix_operating_system/?ref=share&ref_source=link). The video discusses some of the goals of the UNIX system (explained by some of its main developers!) but also shows how far we have come in the last 35 years.
