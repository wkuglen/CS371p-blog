Through the ups and downs of the semester, I really enjoyed this course. In class I liked Professor Downing’s teaching style because it kept me focused on the content. I was not a big fan of the daily quizzes because I didn’t do too well on them but I think they were helpful in the long run. Outside of the lectures, I thought the projects were interesting. They were not too difficult, especially when working with a partner. I spent around 10 to 15 hours over the course of two weeks on each project. The hardest project was definitely the last project, Life, but it was still manageable. I also enjoyed the guest speakers because they helped reinforce why we used the tools we learned in this class. I thought both midterms, which were entirely multiple choice and in the evening, were an appropriate difficulty.

Overall, I was glad I took this course because I learned a lot beyond object-oriented programming that applies to software development. I hope to take another class with Professor Downing in the future.
