### What did you do this past week?
Last week was my busiest week so far this semester. The last big task I had this week was the test in this class. Since I was busy the rest of the week, I did not get to study as much as I would have liked. I got a B on the exam, which I was happy with for the amount I studied.

### What's in your way?
Since most of my exams occurred and my assignments were due last week, I do not really have anything in my way.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I plan to work on things I have been neglecting over the past few weeks. I plan to continue applying for jobs. I also need to find an apartment (or something similar) for next year. Once Project 3 is released, I will start to work on that.

### What's my experience of the class?
This week my experience of the class is entirely based on the exam. I thought the exam was a good difficulty (it was not too easy nor too hard). This exam was the first time I have taken a test online and I have mixed feelings about the medium. I’m glad the exam was digital because it saves a lot of paper and I got instant feedback. However, I disliked the fact that an online exam has multiple points of failure, such as the website crashing, the Wi-Fi failing, or a computer crashing. Despite these downsides, I don’t really have a preference for or against online exams.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to make the most of Spring Break. If you are going on a vacation, try to do everything you need to do for school before you leave (or at least before Sunday night) so you can enjoy the time off without worry. If you don’t have any plans for the week, use the time to get ahead in your classes, tie up loose ends (like applying for jobs), or do something fun that you haven’t done in a while. Don’t know what to do? Read a book. Get outside and take a walk in the park or go for a swim. Go to a new restaurant with friends or family you haven’t seen recently. Have a productive but fun Spring Break!
