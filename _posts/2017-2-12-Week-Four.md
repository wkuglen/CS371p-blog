title: Week 4

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we covered generic functions (functions that can take different types by using the template keyword). We also discussed Project 2: Voting, a ballot counting system based on the Australian style of voting.

### What's in your way?
This weekend I got sick. Unlike week 1, where I had a minor cold or allergies, this time I have had more serious symptoms, such as a fever. Unfortunately, being sick has prevented me from getting things done this weekend but I hope I can get better soon (especially since there is a lot going on this week). My partner for Project 2 also got sick this weekend, which is good since we don’t need to worry about getting the other sick. Of course this also means that we need to worry about actually finishing the project.

### What will you do next week?
Next week is a busy week. The (CNS) Career Fair is on Tuesday. I also have my first midterm of the semester on Thursday. Unfortunately, Project 2: Voting is also due Thursday. My partner and I have already decided to finish the project by Tuesday or Wednesday so that we can study for midterms.

### What's my experience of the class?
This past week was not the best week I have had in OOP. First off, I thought the quizzes were harder. I also thought that the second project description was a little confusing at first. Finally, I felt that the Voting project would have been a good opportunity to use object-oriented programming concepts but we couldn’t use dynamic memory allocation.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is a C++ reference I have been using this week: [cplusplus.com](cplusplus.com). Cplusplus.com describes common and standard C++ functions and structures. Since it would be impossible to learn all of C++ in class, this website helps fill in the gaps.
