title: Week 11

### What did you do this past week?
Several things happened this week for this class. Outside of class Project 4: Darwin was due Thursday. In class we discussed move constructors and move assignments, which explicitly take r-values as an argument (a concept that I have never heard of before and never considered a use for). Using the move constructors and move assignments, we finished up our reimplementation of C++’s vector class.

### What's in your way?
Time management and the consequences of poor time management are currently in my way. This weekend I had a chance to get ahead but instead I spent my time doing other things like exploring Austin. While I firmly believe that people need to take time to enjoy themselves, I know that my lack of productivity this weekend will impact the amount of work I have the rest of the week.

### What will you do next week?
After my unproductive weekend, I need to get back on schedule with my academic work this week. For this class, I will start Project 5. My goal for this week is to get enough done (and to not be behind) so that I can have a relaxing but productive weekend.

### What's my experience of the class?
In terms of the lectures, this week was a fairly typical week for class. I really enjoyed Project 4: Darwin because I felt like I was able to apply a lot of what I learned in class (and in previous classes) to the project. For example, I used my knowledge from CS 429 to help me build a basic and easily readable instruction set for the species. I also was able to apply the class building structures that we learned in this class.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to do everything in moderation, a cliché bit of advice but something that I think people (myself included) often forget in college. In other words, people should strive for a work-life balance that makes them most happy and most successful.
