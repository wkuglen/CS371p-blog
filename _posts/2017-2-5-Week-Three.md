### What did you do this past week?
Last week was an eventful week for this class. On Wednesday UTCS alumni came to talk about working at Bloomberg and their lives as software developers. On Thursday the first project (Collatz) was due.

### What's in your way?
The only thing in my way for this class is remembering to keep up with Piazza. Because I didn’t check Piazza frequently enough, I almost missed a quiz after class. It would have also made the Collatz project easier if I had read the Piazza posts as they were posted instead of all at once when I was trying to do the project.

### What will you do next week?
My main goal for next week is to resume the internship hunting process. I would like to prepare for the career fair and choose the companies I will visit. I also plan to find companies online that I can apply to that won’t be at the career fair. My goal for next week for this class is to start the second project early.

### What's my experience of the class?
Once again, I really enjoyed this class this week. The project workflow was not as bad as I previously anticipated. The Bloomberg visit on Wednesday was the first time I have had a company give a talk in one of my classes. It was nice to see the tools we were learning in this class, such as C++, being used at places like Bloomberg. I also appreciate the fact that the emphasis of this class is not only learning OOP and software tools but also getting an internship (especially since I don’t have one for this summer yet).

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is actually a game I found in this [article](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3067405/the-founder-a-game-about-the-dark-side-of-silicon-valley) about startups called *[The Founder](http://thefounder.biz)* by Francis Tseng. This free game is about the tech industry (especially the startup industry) and how your choices impact the world around you, for better or for worse.
