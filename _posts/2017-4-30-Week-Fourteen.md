### What did you do this past week?
This past week was the last week of quizzes, with the last two quizzes on Monday and Wednesday. In class we continued to discuss virtual methods and learned about handle classes.

### What's in your way?
The only thing in my way for this class is studying for the exam. However, I have a lot going on in my other classes, so I am fairly stressed.

### What will you do next week?
The exam for this class is Thursday evening next week. I plan to study throughout the week for the exam. I have two final projects also due Thursday in my other classes. Fortunately, after Thursday, I only have one class left with one final exam.

### What's my experience of the class?
I am glad quizzes are over. Throughout the course of the class, I never really performed consistently well on the quizzes. I tried studying before the quizzes, but I never did significantly better. I do not think I missed questions due to a lack of understanding but rather a lack of paying attention to the details of the question. However, since the quizzes indicate and mimic what is on the test, I wish we still had quizzes so that I can be sure that I have retained the material of the last few days.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Having a smartphone can be a blessing and a curse. It can help you be more productive, especially when you lack access to a computer. However, if you are like me, then a phone can be a distraction or another way to procrastinate. Personally, I lose track of time when I am on my phone, which can be dangerous, especially in the middle of finals season. That is why my pick-of-the-week is [Moment]( https://inthemoment.io), an iOS app that tracks how long you are on your phone. I havenâ€™t used Moment for very long, but I think it has helped me to use my phone less. You can get Moment for free on the App Store [here]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moment-screen-time-tracker/id771541926?mt=8).
