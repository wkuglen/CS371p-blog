title: Week 5
---

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we talked about lambda functions, iterators, and constants in class. The CNS Career Fair was on Tuesday. Project 2: Voting was also due on Thursday.

### What's in your way?
Now that Project 2 is over, my biggest issue is time management. Over the past week I procrastinated and managed my time poorly. This resulted in me staying up late to finish homework and assignments. By staying up later than usual, I messed up my sleep schedule. At the end of the week my poor time management and my messed up sleep schedule caused me to be really late to class on Friday (which starts at 1 pm) to the point where I missed most of the material.

### What will you do next week?
My top priority for next week is to better manage my time and to get my sleep schedule back on track. In other words, I plan to get all of my assignments done on time and I plan to be on time to all of my classes. My second priority is to start studying for the test (which is in two weeks). My third priority is to apply to or email the companies I talked to at the Career Fair.

### What's my experience of the class?
As far as the class goes, I felt like I learned a lot this week. In addition to the material from the lectures, I learned a lot from Project 2. While Project 2 was harder than Project 1, I thought Project 2 made me explore C++ more. For example, I learned more about standard input and basic library data structures in C++. Once again, I found the quizzes to be hard, but it was more of my own lack of understanding rather than objectively challenging questions.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is Microsoft, Google, and Apple’s developer conferences (which were all announced before or during the past week). [Microsoft Build 2017](https://build.microsoft.com) is May 10 – 12, in Seattle, Washington, but is sold out (finals are May 10 – 16 anyways). [Google IO 2017]( https://events.google.com/io/?gclid=CjwKEAiAoaXFBRCNhautiPvnqzoSJABzHd6h6CIxs7HUmTQMsK22U1k_1nVR1s8nwRhyfdAyDv_krhoCDeDw_wcB) is May 17 – 19, in Mountain View, California, and tickets go on sale this week. [Apple WWDC 2017](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) is June 5 – 9, in San Jose, California, and tickets go on sale soon. Regardless of whether or you can go or not, I advise streaming (or reading a summary of) the main presentation of the conference. While these companies don’t necessarily release new products at the conferences, they preview new technologies or advancements on pre-existing platforms that shape software development over the course of the following year.
