title: Week 12

### What did you do this past week?
This past week I got sick (or had really bad allergies), which negatively influenced my whole week. In class we discussed Project 5: Life. We also talked about more object-oriented topics, especially ways that might be helpful to the project.

### What's in your way?
I have a lot going on this week in my classes. I have an exam on Monday and a project due Tuesday. For this class, I have Project 5 due Thursday.

### What will you do next week?
I haven’t had the chance to really start Project 5 because I was sick. So this week, I plan to start and finish Project 5. After my exam and project, I should have the rest of the time to finish the project.

### What's my experience of the class?
Since I was sick, I ended up missing class on Friday. As a result I missed the quiz and I lost points for attendance (because I was called on to answer a question). I’m not quite sure how the attendance points factor into my grade (since it is not mentioned on the syllabus). Other than missing Friday, this was a normal week.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This week I have two (hopefully obvious) pieces of advice. My first tip-of-the-week is to make sure you know a few of your classmates. You don’t have to be friends with them (although more friends isn’t necessarily a bad thing) but you should know them enough to be able to ask questions or study with them. For example, when I missed class on Friday I was able to ask my friends what I missed. My second tip-of-the-week is (for this class) to partner up quickly if you want to work with someone on a project. In the past I have had a partner for the projects because I decided to work with a friend early on. This time I decided to find a partner too late and everyone I knew was unavailable. So for this project, I have decided to work by myself (which is fine) but I think I would have found someone to work with if I had looked earlier.
