### What did you do this past week?
Last week in class we covered method overriding and virtual methods. On Thursday, Project 5: Life was due.

### What's in your way?
Now that Project 5 is over, the last big thing in this class is the exam. In my other classes I have exams and projects to do before the exam in this class. While I will be focusing on my other classes, I do not want to slack off in this class before the last week of class.

### What will you do next week?
Since I have a lot going on in my other classes and I don’t have much left to do in this class, I am going to focus on my other classes next week. However, I would like to practice some more C++ before the exam, especially things we cover in the next few classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
This week was a good week in class. I understand what we learned but I know virtual methods will be tricky to analyze on quizzes and exams because of their strict rules (which can be easily missed in a time crunch). I enjoyed Project 5 and was happy I could do it without getters and setters. However, I thought Project 5 was the hardest project, and I could not optimize it to solve the last test of Cell on HackerRank.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This week, my pick-of-the-week is a programming game by Zachtronics called [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/). The point of the game is to solve a bunch of puzzles by programming a bunch of register-like nodes using a pseudo-language similar to assembly. Furthermore, each puzzle can be optimized to use the fewest instructions, cycles, or nodes (often at the expense of the other resources). I’d recommend this game to anyone who liked CS 429 (Computer Architecture), anyone interested in low-level languages, or anyone who wants to learn how small changes can have a huge impact on performance.
